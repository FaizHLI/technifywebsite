            <h2>Olympic Gold Quest (OCQ) (2024)</h2>
            <p>Olympic Gold Quest is an Indian NGO helping underprivileged athletes in India pursue Olympic medals. OGQ currently supports around 400 athletes across 10 Olympic and 8 Paralympic sports. This includes approximately 150 junior athletes supported through the OGQ Junior Program and 101 para athletes supported through the OGQ Para Program. The project involved revamping OGQ's website, as their original website lacked integration between the front-end and back-end, as well as building a functional code-based admin panel and database.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>PERWITI Soup Kitchen (2021)</h2>
            <p>PERWITI is an NGO in Malaysia that feeds the poor and homeless. Technify members had the opportunity to build a web application that recruits and onboards new volunteers while promoting the work of PERWITI soup kitchens in Kuala Lumpur. The web application provides live updates on soup kitchen operations for the general public and potential volunteers to view. It also includes backend controls for PERWITI to register volunteers. Through recruiting more volunteers, the organization is able to feed over 50% of the homeless population in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

            <h2>Technify Internal Website (2024)</h2>
            <p>In the academic year of 2024â€“2025, Technify relied solely on LinkedIn and Instagram as its primary sources of media exposure. The previous website was deactivated, so the club needed to revamp the website almost from scratch. We developed a new website (the website you are on!) to serve as a resource hub, helping to raise awareness about Technify's initiatives and providing tools for members and the community.</p>
