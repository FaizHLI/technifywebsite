        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <div class = "our-mission">
        <p> Technify is a student-run organization at Duke University, 
            bridging the gap between gaining hands-on work experience 
            with real clients and creating meaningful social impact. 
            We connect undergraduates who are aspiring product managers, 
            software engineers, UI/UX designers, or tech consultants 
            with non-profit clients worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, our student teams design and deploy innovative products, 
            often apps and websites, to meet their client’s needs and enable them
            to raise funds, spread awareness,
            and measure their impact more effectively.
            As a student member, you will receive tailored training and support, 
            ensuring you can excel in your role regardless of your current skill set. 
            Your technify project can help you build a competitive portfolio for 
            internships/jobs while using your invaluable skills and your time to
            empower a resource-constrained partner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to shape the professional culture of Duke to include social impact, 
            and we’ve partnered with non-profits in countries such as the Philippines, India, Nepal, Venezuela, and Israel. 
            We encourage all Duke students eager to gain experience and any non-profits seeking free and high-quality tech solutions to reach out!
             We want to help you succeed.
        </p>
